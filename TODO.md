# TODO!  
Please pretend everything is perfect and this does not exist thank you :-)

## UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Activities and Opportunities page headers are slightly high on the page
- [ ] Full page activities and opportunities should be reformatted
- [ ] Schedule automatically incrementing progress bar
- [ ] Reminders sidebar to the right of schedule   
- [ ] Display submission status to authors, and if planned/archived to all
- [ ] Activity and opportunity date selector could be prettier?
    - [ ] Could also account for timezone differences
- [ ] Status button click outside button to close
- [ ] Modal click background to close
- [ ] Maybe modernize navbar?  The fancy rounded blurred one or a side nav

## Features
- [ ] Add, remove, publish, unpublish schedule events
    - [ ] Links to in class content
    - [ ] Modals to see more class content information
- [ ] Allow opportunity authors to see signed up users
    - [ ] Export signed up users
    - [ ] Email users (maybe with nice tracking)
- [ ] A FAQ section, maybe forum style
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Un-signup, unvote
- [ ] Profile page
    - [ ] Display personal submissions
    - [ ] Keep track of signed up opportunities and voted activities
- [ ] A way to submit reports of attended opportunities?
    - [ ] If so, embed button to open form into opportunity itself
- [ ] Correct redirects to login when creating/editing and not logged in 
- [ ] This mystery: javascript:throw new Error('A React form was unexpectedly submitted. If you called form.submit() manually, consider using form.requestSubmit() instead. If you\'re trying to use event.stopPropagation() in a submit event handler, consider also calling event.preventDefault().')

## Code
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Some components are client and/or async and do not need to be
- [ ] Fix the mangled imports
- [ ] Some components are not precisely named
